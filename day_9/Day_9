Sure, here's an explanation of each of the mentioned Node.js modules:

a. Express: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It facilitates the creation of server-side web applications, RESTful APIs, and more. Express simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware integration, and other common web development tasks.

b. Body-parser: Body-parser is a middleware for handling HTTP request bodies in Node.js. It is commonly used with Express to parse incoming request bodies before they are handled by the application's routes. Body-parser can parse various types of request bodies, including JSON, URL-encoded, and raw.

c. Socket.io: Socket.io is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers in Node.js. It allows for the creation of WebSocket-based applications that can send and receive data instantly, making it ideal for applications requiring real-time updates, such as chat applications, online gaming, and collaborative editing tools. Socket.io handles the complexity of managing WebSocket connections and provides a simple API for developers to work with.
